# Garbage Collector Robot

Garbage Collector Robot is a C++ program for operating an autonomous garbage collector circuit designed in TinkerCAD.

## Getting Started

To get your own copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Create a TinkerCAD account and remix this circuit:
```
https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4fSPcRKKsw4-garbage-collector-circuit?sharecode=6yojYYe3HvXMVsBnrGn9Loo67GNXimtfMbCXNoaned4
```

Alternatively, you can create your own circuit from this diagram in TinkerCAD or in reality by copying this design:

### Usage

The flowchart below illustrates the decision-making process of the garbage collector robot in response to its environment stimuli. It outlines the steps the robot takes to detect and respond to various conditions while navigating its surroundings.

### Interactive Testing
You can interactively test the circuit using TinkerCAD. By referring to the flowchart provided above, you can simulate different scenarios and observe how the garbage collector robot reacts to different inputs. This interactive testing feature allows you to validate the functionality of the circuit and fine-tune its behavior before deployment.

## Contributing

Garbage Collector Robot is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are welcome.

## Motivation

I worked with a group to brainstorm a solution to solve labor shortage for waste management and road maintenance in the Midwestern states. You can visit the Google document link to learn more about the project. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PUsQxcsFU5o0_J592JQgFwT9JW8BSsPSACpfz4RUuao/edit?usp=sharing.

## Notes

I would be interested in expanding upon this circuit and improving the code in the future. Some things I would add are:
* More precise object avoidance and path routing
* An automated routing solution
* A physical prototype
